# rock-paper-scissors

This is my take on the Rock Paper Scissors Javascript project that is part of the Fundamentals course on The Odin Project. It's a game of Rock Paper Scissors played on the browser console where the player chooses between the three choices and goes up against a randomly generated choice from the computer. It is a 5-round game, and after 5 rounds the winner is announced if there is one, otherwise it will be a tie.
